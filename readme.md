# Task
The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.

Sample output is shown below.
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4

# Run application

```shell
$ node app.js <list of numbers> <sum>
```

## example 
1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
```shell
node app.js 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
```
output
